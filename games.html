            One of the most iconic games played during Holi is the "Rangoli
            Competition." In this colorful activity, participants create
            intricate and vibrant patterns or designs on the ground using
            colored powders, flower petals, and other natural materials. The
            designs range from traditional motifs to contemporary artistry,
            showcasing creativity and artistic flair. Rangoli competitions often
            bring out friendly competition among participants, with prizes
            awarded for the most creative and visually appealing designs.

            Another popular game is the "Matki Phod" or "Dahi Handi," inspired
            by the legendary tales of Lord Krishna. In this game, a clay pot
            filled with buttermilk or colored water is suspended at a height,
            and teams of enthusiastic players compete to break the pot by
            forming human pyramids. The game requires coordination, teamwork,
            and physical strength, creating an exhilarating and festive
            atmosphere as spectators cheer on the participants.

            Holi is also synonymous with playful water fights, known as
            "Pichkari Battles." Participants armed with colorful water guns
            called "pichkaris" spray each other with water mixed with colored
            powders, creating a joyful spectacle of splashes and laughter. Water
            balloons are also popular during Holi, adding an element of surprise
            and fun to the festivities as people chase each other, trying to
            drench their friends and family members in colorful water.

            Another entertaining activity during Holi is the "Tug-of-War with
            Colors." Teams compete against each other in a colorful twist on the
            classic tug-of-war game, where participants hold onto a rope while
            trying to pull the opposing team across a designated line. The added
            challenge comes from being covered in colored powders, making the
            game even more exciting and amusing for everyone involved.

        In addition to these games and activities, Holi is also a time for
        indulging in delicious festive treats, exchanging gifts and greetings,
        and strengthening bonds with family and friends. Whether playing
        traditional games, creating colorful art, dancing to lively music, or
        enjoying festive delicacies, Holi brings people together in a spirit of
        joy, unity, and celebration, making it one of the most cherished and
